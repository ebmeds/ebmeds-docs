# FHIR resources in EBMEDS

## SelfCareQuestionnaire

*Inherits from*: [Questionnaire](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html)

*FHIR profile*: [SelfCareQuestionnaire](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareQuestionnaire)

The FHIR [Questionnaire resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire.html) is a general way of describing, you guessed it, questionnaires.

### Example

An example resource is:

```json
{
  "resourceType":"Questionnaire",
  "language":"fi",

          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

With the fields:

* `resourceType` (string): Always `Questionnaire`.
* `language` (string): What language is the form written in? BCP47 language tag, e.g. `fi` or `fi-FI`.
* `url` (string): Globally unique URL for this questionnaire.
* `status` (string): Can be `active`, `draft` or `retired`. Only active questionnaires should be used in production.
* `date` (string): ISO 8601 date of when the Questionnaire was created or last modified.
* `publisher` (string): Who published the Questionnaire. Usually Duodecim.
* `copyright` (string): Standard copyright notice.
* `identifier` (array of objects): Identifying codes, in practice only one object is listed.
    * `system` (string): `'http://duodecim.fi/fhir/sid/vkt-questionnaire-id'`, an internally defined code system.
    * `code` (string): The unique ID for this questionnaire (although different versions may exist with the same ID).
* `title` (string): The title of this questionnaire.
* `text` (object): A FHIR Narrative object, i.e. a human-readable description of the contents of this resource. Has the following fields:
    * `status` (string): Always `'generated'`.
    * `div` (string): A string containing an XHTML `div` with the contents. Note that entity references are not allowed.
* `item` (array of objects): The field describing one or more questions. Items may contain other items, forming a tree structure.

### Questionnaire items

The example Questionnaire above contains an assortment of the most common variants of a question item: the different question types, as well as the usage display logic (`enableWhen`) and custom extensions.

The fields in `item` are as follows.

* `item` (object): Items may contain other items.
* `linkId` (string): A unique ID for identifying this question in the form.
* `text` (string, markdown, **optional**): A markdown string containing the question text. May contain light text formatting and links to images. Not needed for certain item types, e.g. `group`.
* `required` (boolean): Whether or not this question is required to be answered. Questions with `type: 'display'` or `type: 'group'` can not be `required`. The `required` property is also not applicable to questions that are not visible to the user due to display logic hiding them. As a rule of thumb, the Questionnaires generated by Duodecim assume that all (visible and answerable) questions are required.
* `type` (string): One of `'decimal'`, `'boolean'`, `'string'`, `'integer'`, `'decimal'`, `'date'`, `'dateTime'`, '`choice`' for actual questions. We also have the special types `'group'` (that only contains other items) and `'display'` which is used to show some informative text and/or subtitles (in markdown). See section "Question types" below.
* `enableWhen` (array of objects): A list of criteria for when this question should be visible to the user. Each criterium in the list is connected to the other by boolean OR operators by default, with AND operators being implemented by an extension. See the section "Questionnaire extensions".

### Questionnaire extensions

See the [extensions page](extensions.md).

## SelfCareQuestionnaireResponse

*Inherits from*: [QuestionnaireResponse](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/questionnaireresponse.html)

*FHIR profile*: [SelfCareQuestionnaireResponse](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareQuestionnaireResponse)

The [SelfCareQuestionnaireResponse](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareQuestionnaireResponse) is the counterpart to a Questionnaire: it contains the answers that the user has provided. This can be sent to EBMEDS for decision support.

Here is a complete example:

```json
{
  "resourceType": "QuestionnaireResponse",
  "id": "0685d814-f4af-41a3-8547-5c7e5f97c923",
  "questionnaire": {
    "identifier": {
      "system": "https://duodecim.fi/fhir/sid/vkt-questionnaire-id",
      "value": "21"
    }
  },
  "status": "completed",
  "item": [
    {
      "linkId": "introduction",
      "text": "Introductory text of the questionnaire. Also a container item. Has no answer, but contains other items. The text is written in markdown, so it may contain [links](https://ebmeds.org).",
      "item": [
        {
          "linkId": "266",
          "text": "A display-type question in the Questionnaire, has no answer but must also be present in the QuestionnaireResponse according to the FHIR spec."
        },
        {
          "linkId": "3",
          "text": "A question with a numeric answer. (For example, age.)",
          "answer": [
            {
              "valueDecimal": 45
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "linkId": "306",
          "text": "'Check box' type multiple choice questions may naturally have > 1 answers.",
          "answer": [
            {
              "valueCoding": {
                "id": "452"
              }
            },
            {
              "valueCoding": {
                "id": "453"
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "linkId": "305",
          "text": "A 'radio button' type multiple choice question. In the QuestionnaireResponse, looks identical to a checkbox answer with one answer checked.",
          "answer": [
            {
              "valueCoding": {
                "id": "462"
              }
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "linkId": "23",
          "text": "A boolean-type question. In the Questionnaire this question contains display logic, i.e. the question is only visible when certain other questions have been answered in a certain way. In this example, the numerical answer in question ID 3 must be between 15 and 99.",
          "answer": [
            {
              "valueBoolean": true
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

So the structure has the following fields:

* `resourceType` (string): Always `QuestionnaireResponse`.
* `id` (string, **optional**): A unique ID, UUID works great. Not needed for CDS, but good to have for archiving purposes.
* `questionnaire.identifier` (object): A unique identifier for the Questionnaire that this QuestionnaireResponse answers.
    * `system` (string): Always `https://duodecim.fi/fhir/sid/vkt-questionnaire-id`
    * `value` (string): A unique ID for the Questionnaire.
* `status` (string): Always `completed`.
* `item` (array of objects): Tree hierarchy of the answers to the questionnaire. The hierarchy must be the same as the question hierarchy in the Questionnaire.
    * `item` (see above, **optional**): Items may contain other items.
    * `linkId` (string): The unique ID of the question in the Questionnaire resource (also named `linkId` there). This ID is in fact globally unique for all Duodecim Questionnaires.
    * `answer` (array, **optional**): array of objects with property `value[x]`, corresponding to the Questionnaire `answer[x]` field for the question. The length of the array is always 1, or >= 1 if it is a multiple choice question (`valueCoding`).
        * `valueBoolean` (boolean): A yes or no question answer.
        * `valueDecimal` (number): A decimal-valued question answer.
        * `valueCoding` (object): has one property, `id` (string), the ID of the wanted answer. Also globally unique ID in all Duodecim Questionnaires.
    * `text` (markdown string, **optional**): The question text from the Questionnaire repeated here, mostly to aid debugging.

## SelfCareActivityDefinition

*Inherits from*: [ActivityDefinition](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/activitydefinition.html)

*FHIR profile*: [SelfCareActivityDefinition](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareActivityDefinition/)

The main point of the FHIR resource [SelfCareActivityDefinition](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareActivityDefinition/) is to describe an action. In the traditional CDS context the primary unit is the reminder, an informative message that may have an encoded action suggestion attached to it. In the self-care context it is the other way around: we return actions that have messages attached to them.

In practice, this means that if several reminders suggest the same action, only one SelfCareActivityDefinition is returned, with several reminder texts attached to it. This also means that the card structure of CDS hooks becomes meaningless, see the discussion at the bottom of [this page](cds-hooks.md#customselfcarecardformat).

### Data model

The ActivityDefinitions in the `selfcare-*` hooks separate the reminder texts from their suggested actions. Given a set of reminders, each with 0 or more suggested actions attached to them, the reminder texts and actions are split up into several SelfCareActivityDefinitions:

1. Zero or one ActivityDefinition containing the code system `https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/activity-definition-custom-actions` and the code `read-reminder`. This resource contains all reminder texts with severity level `reminder` in its `topic.text` field.
2. Zero or one ActivityDefinition containing the code system `https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/activity-definition-custom-actions` and the code `read-prompt`. This resource contains all reminder texts with severity level `prompt` in its `topic.text` field.
3. Zero or one ActivityDefinition containing the code system `https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/activity-definition-custom-actions` and the code `read-alert`. This resource contains all reminder texts with severity level `alert` in its `topic.text` field.
4. Zero or more ActivityDefinition containing any other code system and code, representing the actual actions.

In other words: ActivityDefinitions of type 1-3 may or may not be present, but at least one of them contains at least one reminder text. See below for an example.

### Code systems

These code systems are used when coding an ActivityDefinition. See the [code systems page](code-systems.md) for more detailed information.

* `https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/activity-definition-custom-actions`: custom codes identifying special types of ActivityDefinitions, like above.
* `http://91.202.112.142/codeserver/pages/classification-view-page.xhtml?classificationKey=2023&versionKey=2283` a.k.a. OID `1.2.246.537.6.49`: THL Sosiaali- ja terveysalan palvelunimikkeistö
* `http://91.202.112.142/codeserver/pages/classification-view-page.xhtml?classificationKey=88&versionKey=120` a.k.a. OID `1.2.246.537.6.3`: Kuntaliitto

### Restrictions

Some restrictions have been put in place to simplify data processing, using the [SelfCareActivityDefinition](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareActivityDefinition/) profile.

* A SelfCareActivityDefinition is described by exactly one code, i.e. `code` must be present and `code.coding` may contain only one coding. The coding represents some kind of action.
* A reminder must have exactly one `participant`, i.e. the intended recipient of this SelfCareActivityDefinition. This is either the patient or a medical professional.
* The ActivityDefinitions are always freshly generated, so their `status` is always `active`.

### Example

Below is an example of the two kinds of SelfCareActivityDefinitions (one describing an action, one containing reminder texts) in a CDS response:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "summary": "Selfcare action suggestions",
      "indicator": "info",
      "source": {

          "participant": [
            {
              "type": "patient"
            }
          ],
          "kind": "Observation",
          "code": {
            "coding": [
              {

                "display": "Yleislääkärin päivystyksen palvelut - Hoidetaan päivystyksenä"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "resourceType": "ActivityDefinition",
          "status": "active",
          "copyright": "Kustannus Oy Duodecim, 2017",
          "participant": [
            {
              "type": "patient"
            }
          ],
          "kind": "CommunicationRequest",
          "code": {
            "coding": [
              {
                "system": "https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/activity-definition-custom-actions",
                "code": "read-reminder",
                "display": "Lue muistutteet"
              }
            ]
          },
          "topic": [
            {
              "text": "Oireesi voivat johtua virtsatietulehduksesta, joka voi olla munuaistasoinen. Hakeudu päivystysvastaanotolle.",
              "coding": [
                {
                  "system": "https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/reminder-id",
                  "code": "46bea5c0-c18e-4e78-a20c-06974bae60f7",
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

And the fields are described as follows.

* `resourceType` (string): Always `ActivityDefinition` for this resource.
* `status` (string): Only `active` ActivityDefinitions are returned.
* `code` (object, CodeableConcept): The code describing the action.
    * `coding`: container object for a code + code system
        * `system` (string): The code system used in this code. See [a list of used code systems](code-systems.html).
        * `code` (string): The actual code, a symbol in the given system.
        * `display` (string): Human-readable description of the action.
* `topic` (array, **optional**):
    * `text` (markdown string): The reminder text itself. May contain http links and text with light styling.
    * `coding.code` (UUID): The unique ID of this particular reminder message.
    * `coding.system`: Always `https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/reminder-id`.
* `participant` (array of objects): A list of participants and their roles. In practice there is only ever one entry in this list. Each object contains the following field:
    * `type` (string): one of `patient`, `practitioner` or `related-person`. Only `patient` is in practical use at the moment.
* `copyright` (string): A standard copyright notice.

## SelfCareObservation

*Inherits from*: [Observation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html)

*FHIR profile*: [SelfCareObservation](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareObservation/)

A very simple resource describing some new observation made about the patient from the basis of his or her patient data.

### Example

```
{
  "status": "final",
  "code": {
    "coding": [
      {
        "system": "https://duodecim.fi/fhir/stu3/CodeSystem/custom-observations",
        "code": "potential-extra-years"
      }

  "effectiveDateTime": "2018-04-25T11:13:56.894Z",
  "valueQuantity": {
    "unit": "a",
    "value": 5
  }
}
```

And the fields are the following:

* `code.coding`: The code system and coding describing the concept.
* `effectiveDateTime` (date string): When this observation was created.
* `valueQuantity` or `valueString`: The actual value, either as a number with a unit (Quantity) or as a string.

## SelfCareRiskAssessment

*Inherits from*: [RiskAssessment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/riskassessment.html)

*FHIR profile*: [SelfCareRiskAssessment](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/SelfCareRiskAssessment/)

A resource describing some newly calculated risk regarding the patient, from the basis of his or her patient data. The risk is always associated with a certain outcome (with a diagnosis code or similar), and the age range in years for which this risk is applicable for this particular patient. The risk probability is always given as a decimal between 0 and 1.

### Example

```
{
  "status": "final",
  "prediction": [
    "outcome": {
      "coding": [{
        "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
        "code": "414545008"
      }]
    },
    "probabilityDecimal": 0.40,
    "whenRange": {
      "low": {
        "value": 52,
        "unit": "a"
      },
      "high": {
        "value": 62,
        "unit": "a"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

And the fields are the following:

* `prediction.outcome`: The code system and coding describing the outcome that may occur.
* `prediction.probabilityDecimal` (decimal between 0 and 1): The probability of the outcome occurring.
* `whenRange`: The patient's age range for which this risk has been calculated.

## Resources for general CDS

At the moment, EBMEDS best supports questionnaire-based decision support in FHIR, using the resources described above. For a full-blown CDS service, a large range of other clinical data about a person can and should be included. The resources for describing these is in a very experimental stage, and the profiles will probably change once real-world use is initiated. The documentation is therefore still mostly in the profiles themselves:

* [CDSImmunization](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/CDSImmunization)
* [CDSMedicationStatement](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/CDSMedicationStatement)
* [CDSProcedure](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/CDSProcedure)
* [CDSProcedureRequest](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/CDSProcedureRequest)
* [DiagnosisCondition](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/DiagnosisCondition)
* [DrugAllergyIntolerance](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/DrugAllergyIntolerance)
* [MeasurementObservation](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/MeasurementObservation)
* [MonitoringGoal](https://simplifier.net/DuodecimCDS/MonitoringGoal)
